# Password-Generator
Challenge 3

This Week, I was asked to create an password generator that meet the following requirement:

1.	Enable to choose from Caps, small letters, numbers, and special symbol.
2.	Can be a length of 8 -128 parameter
3.	In random order

I googled a lot of functions, and a JQuery library. 

The challenge I met include the using of loops, and I will request an tutor session regarding the github issue, and I will resubmit all assignments for a better score.
